"""Architecture B - staged, two agents.

Agent 1 (Procurement Analyst) gathers evidence with the tools and writes a
structured evidence pack.
Agent 2 (Policy and Risk Reviewer) reads only that pack plus the deterministic
facts, and decides. It never sees the raw request text, so anything hidden in
the requester's free text cannot reach the agent that makes the call.

Same tools and same rules engine as Architecture A. The only difference is the
handoff, which is the point of the comparison.
